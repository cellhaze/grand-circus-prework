        <p>
        My experience as a Fine Arts student leaves me prepared to work long hours as well as left me comfortable working with frequent deadlines. In a field notorious for having expensive supplies, I have learned how to improvise and if need be, build my own tools to ensure my success. I’m able to constructively receive criticism and adapt accordingly.
